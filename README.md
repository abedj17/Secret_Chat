# Secret Chat
Description: Developed a highly secure messaging application called "Secret Chat" that leverages RSA and AES encryption algorithms to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of messages. Implemented advanced encryption techniques such as RSA for key exchange and AES for encrypting message content. Additionally, incorporated screen protection functionality to prevent unauthorized access and implemented measures to prevent screenshots within the application. The project resulted in a comprehensive solution that ensures secure communication, protects against unauthorized access, and prevents sensitive information from being captured through screenshots.
